# Cara-a-Cara

This is a copy of the popular brazilian game "Cara a Cara", made for me using godot.

# Rules

The rules of the game are simple, it has 2 players, and each has a character and a list of possible characters, the main objective is to discover the other player's character by asking questions about his character, that way is possible to eliminate the possibilities until you end up with only one possibility, the first to discover the other character wins.
